# Grymm’s Pups of Perpetuity - *A simple QOL mod for ASKA.*  

Tired of puppers going belly-up because Kyle (or whatever kennel worker) “forgot” to refill the bowl again?  

Me too! Grymm’s Pups of Perpetuity keeps dogs hungry-but-alive, so the only thing dying in your village is Kyle’s credibility.

## Features

- **Pets never starve to death.** Dogs can still get hungry and they still take normal combat damage, but **they do not lose health from hunger**. 
- **Kyle-proof.** They’ll still bark at you until you feed them. Just like real life!

## Patch notes

Problem: Dogs were dying because Kyle wouldn't feed them.  
Solution: Disable starvation damage.  
Result: Dogs live. Kyle still Kyle.
